    <p>I really enjoy going to watch movies at CGV theaters. There's something special about the big screen, the surround sound, and the whole experience that makes each movie feel more exciting. Whether it's a new action film or a heartfelt drama, sitting in a dark theater with popcorn in hand just feels like the perfect escape.</p>
